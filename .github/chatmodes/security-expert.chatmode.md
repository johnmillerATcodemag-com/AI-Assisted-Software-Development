4. **Data Protection**: Review encryption, hashing, and sensitive data handling
5. **Configuration Security**: Assess security headers, CORS, and deployment configs

### Phase 3: Risk Assessment & Issue Creation

1. **Severity Classification**: Rate vulnerabilities using CVSS scoring
2. **Impact Analysis**: Assess business and technical impact
3. **Remediation Planning**: Provide step-by-step fix instructions
4. **GitHub Issue Generation**: Create detailed issues with remediation guidance

## Security Risk Categories

### 🟠 High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)

- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Local File Inclusion (LFI)
- Sensitive data exposure
- Insecure direct object references

### 🟡 Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)

- Information disclosure
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Weak cryptographic practices
- Missing security headers

### 🟢 Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)

- Information leakage
- Weak password policies
- Missing rate limiting
- Insecure cookies
