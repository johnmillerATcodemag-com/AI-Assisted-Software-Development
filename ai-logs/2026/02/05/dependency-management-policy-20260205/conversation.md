Create comprehensive dependency management policy instruction file for the AI-Assisted-Software-Development repository.

TASK: [INST-010] Create dependency management policy

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Read and analyze existing instruction files in .github/instructions/ to understand format and standards
2. Research modern dependency management best practices and security considerations
3. Create `.github/instructions/dependency-management-policy.instructions.md` following the established format
4. Include proper AI-assisted output metadata in front matter
5. Cover these dependency management areas:
   - Dependency selection criteria and approval process
   - Version management and update strategies
   - Security vulnerability monitoring
   - License compliance and legal considerations
   - Dependency isolation and containerization
   - Supply chain security
   - Automated dependency updates
   - Conflict resolution procedures
   - Documentation requirements
   - AI-specific dependency considerations
   - Emergency patching procedures

DELIVERABLES:
- Complete instruction file with proper metadata
- Practical templates and checklists
- Integration with existing development workflows
- Guidelines for AI-assisted dependency management

Focus on creating policies that balance development velocity with security and maintainability requirements.

I'll help you create a comprehensive dependency management policy instruction file. Let me first examine the existing instruction files to understand the format and standards, then create the new policy file.

[Examining existing instruction files to understand format and structure]

I can see the established format includes:
1. YAML front matter with comprehensive AI metadata
2. Clear structure with overview, table of contents, detailed sections
3. Quality checklists
4. Practical examples and templates
5. Target audience and scope definition
6. applyTo field for when to apply instructions

Now I'll create the comprehensive dependency management policy instruction file following these established patterns.

[Creating dependency-management-policy.instructions.md with full coverage of all required areas]

The file includes:
- Complete AI provenance metadata in YAML front matter
- Comprehensive coverage of all 11 specified dependency management areas
- Practical templates and checklists for immediate use
- Risk classification matrices and approval workflows
- Security vulnerability response procedures
- License compliance guidelines and compatibility matrices
- AI/ML specific considerations
- Emergency patching procedures
- Monitoring and compliance frameworks
- Tool recommendations and automation examples
```
