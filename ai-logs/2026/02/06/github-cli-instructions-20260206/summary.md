   - Pull request operations and workflows
   - GitHub Actions and workflow management
   - Release management procedures
   - Organization and team management
   - Advanced features (API access, templating, aliases)
   - Best practices and security considerations
   - Common workflow examples and troubleshooting

### Secondary Work

- AI conversation log creation with proper metadata
- Session summary documentation for resumability
- Following AI-assisted output policy requirements

## Key Decisions

### Comprehensive Coverage Approach

**Decision**: Create a complete reference guide covering all major GitHub CLI use cases
**Rationale**:

- Provides single source of truth for GitHub CLI usage
- Reduces need for external documentation references
- Follows established instruction file format and standards
- Includes practical examples and workflows

### Security-First Approach

**Decision**: Emphasize security best practices throughout the documentation
**Rationale**:

- Token security and rotation procedures
- Access control validation techniques
- Audit trail implementation
- Secure integration patterns
