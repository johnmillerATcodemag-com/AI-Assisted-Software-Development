**Session ID**: github-worktrees-slides-20260206
**Date**: 2026-02-06
**Operator**: johnmillerATcodemag-com
**Model**: anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet@2024-10-22
**Duration**: 00:20:00

## Objective

Create a comprehensive Marp slide deck teaching developers how to use GitHub worktrees for parallel development workflows, including practical examples, hands-on exercises, and best practices.

## Work Completed

### Primary Deliverables

1. **GitHub Worktrees Guide Slides** (`Slides/individual-slides/github-worktrees-guide.md`)
   - 12-slide comprehensive presentation covering Git worktrees from basics to advanced usage
   - Complete with AI-compliant YAML front matter including all required provenance metadata
   - Comprehensive speaker notes for every slide using pandoc `:::notes` syntax
   - Structured learning progression from introduction through hands-on practice

### Secondary Work

- Created supporting AI conversation log following repository policies
- Prepared session summary for resumability and context preservation
- Ensured compliance with marp-slides.instructions.md requirements

## Key Decisions

### Slide Structure and Content Organization

**Decision**: Organized content into 12 slides with progressive learning approach
**Rationale**:

- Balances comprehensiveness with digestibility
- Includes hands-on practice for better retention
- Covers both basic usage and advanced troubleshooting
- Provides clear next steps and resources

### Speaker Notes Approach

**Decision**: Created detailed speaker notes with timing, delivery guidance, and audience interaction cues
**Rationale**: Required by repository marp-slides instructions and essential for effective presentation delivery

### Content Focus Areas

**Decision**: Emphasized practical workflows and real-world use cases over theoretical concepts
**Rationale**: Git worktrees are most valuable when developers understand concrete applications to their daily workflows

## Lessons Learned

1. **Slide Structure Planning**: Starting with a clear learning progression outline made content creation more efficient and ensured comprehensive coverage
2. **Speaker Notes Value**: Detailed speaker notes significantly enhance presentation delivery and make slides reusable by others
3. **Hands-on Integration**: Including a practical exercise slide makes the content more engaging and memorable

## Next Steps

### Immediate

- Update repository README.md with entry for the new slide deck
- Test Marp rendering to ensure proper slide formatting
- Validate all speaker notes render correctly in presentation mode

### Future Enhancements

- Consider creating companion demo repository for hands-on exercises
- Develop advanced worktree topics for follow-up presentations
- Create team-specific workflow templates based on slide content

## Compliance Status

✅ AI-generated artifact with complete YAML front matter
✅ Comprehensive speaker notes using correct pandoc syntax
✅ Conversation log created with proper structure
✅ Session summary includes resumability context
✅ File placed in correct directory structure (Slides/individual-slides/)
⚠️ README.md update pending (next immediate step)
