# Session Summary: Create Custom Agents MARP Slide Deck

**Session ID**: create-custom-agents-marp-20260212
**Date**: 2026-02-12
**Operator**: johnmillerATcodemag-com
**Model**: anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet@2024-10-22
**Duration**: 00:15:00

## Objective

Create a comprehensive MARP slide deck from GitHub's custom agents documentation to teach developers how to create specialized AI assistants for their workflows.

## Work Completed

### Primary Deliverables

1. **MARP Slide Deck** (`Slides/individual-slides/creating-custom-agents.md`)
   - 12 professional slides covering all aspects of creating custom agents
   - Comprehensive speaker notes for every slide using pandoc syntax
   - Full AI provenance metadata in YAML front matter
   - Ready for presentation delivery

### Slide Structure

1. **Title Slide**: Introduction to Custom Agents
2. **Overview**: What custom agents are and their benefits
3. **Creation Locations**: GitHub.com, VS Code, JetBrains, Eclipse, Xcode
4. **GitHub Creation**: Step-by-step walkthrough
5. **VS Code Creation**: IDE-specific workflow
6. **Agent Profile Structure**: YAML and markdown configuration
7. **Example 1**: Testing Specialist agent
8. **Example 2**: Implementation Planner agent
9. **Usage**: How to use agents across platforms
10. **Best Practices**: 7 key practices for success
11. **Next Steps**: Resources and getting started guide
12. **Thank You**: Q&A preparation

### Secondary Work

- Created conversation log with full transcript
- Applied MARP-specific formatting requirements
- Included timing guidance for 30-35 minute presentation
- Added audience interaction points and common questions

## Key Decisions

### Structure and Flow

**Decision**: Organized content from "what" to "how" to "why"
**Rationale**:

- Start with conceptual understanding (what are custom agents)
- Move to practical creation (how to create them)
- Show examples (concrete implementations)
- End with best practices and resources (why and when)
- Natural learning progression for audience

### Speaker Notes Depth

**Decision**: Created extensive speaker notes (3-5 minutes per slide)
**Rationale**:

- Enables first-time presenters to deliver confidently
- Includes delivery instructions and timing
- Provides examples and audience interaction cues
- Addresses common questions proactively
- Ensures consistent message across different presenters

### Example Selection

**Decision**: Used Testing Specialist and Implementation Planner examples
**Rationale**:

- Show contrasting use cases (coding vs planning)
- Demonstrate tool restriction strategies
- Illustrate different boundary-setting approaches
- Provide copy-paste starting points
- Common enough for broad audience relevance

### Platform Coverage

**Decision**: Cover GitHub, VS Code, JetBrains, Eclipse, Xcode
**Rationale**:

- Address full range of supported environments
- Show consistency across platforms
- Help audience choose right approach
- Acknowledge different team workflows

## Artifacts Produced

| Artifact                                                                | Type             | Purpose                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `Slides/individual-slides/creating-custom-agents.md`                    | MARP Slide Deck  | Comprehensive presentation on creating custom agents |
| `ai-logs/2026/02/12/create-custom-agents-marp-20260212/conversation.md` | Conversation Log | Full provenance and development history              |
| `ai-logs/2026/02/12/create-custom-agents-marp-20260212/summary.md`      | Session Summary  | High-level overview for resumability                 |

## Lessons Learned

1. **Speaker Notes Are Critical**: Detailed notes significantly increase presentation quality and consistency
2. **Examples Over Theory**: Concrete, copy-paste examples more valuable than abstract explanations
3. **Progressive Detail**: Start simple (what/why), then add complexity (how/configuration)
4. **Multi-Platform Coverage**: Essential to address where different teams actually work
5. **Timing Guidance**: Helps presenters pace effectively and signals slide complexity
6. **Transition Statements**: Speaker notes should explicitly guide from one slide to next

## Next Steps

### Immediate

- Update README.md with slide deck entry and description
- Verify MARP rendering of the slide deck
- Test speaker notes format in presentation mode

### Future Enhancements

- Add live demo screenshots or recordings
- Create companion workshop materials
- Develop hands-on lab exercises
- Build agent template repository

## Compliance Status

✅ MARP slide format with proper YAML frontmatter
✅ Comprehensive speaker notes for every slide using `::: notes` syntax
✅ AI provenance metadata complete (model, operator, chat_id, timestamps)
✅ Conversation log created with full transcript
✅ Session summary created with resumability context
✅ File in correct location (Slides/individual-slides/)
⏳ README.md update pending (next step)
