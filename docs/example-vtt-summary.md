## Document Overview

- **File**: AI-Assisted Software Development with GitHub Copilot (Tue Afternoon).vtt
- **Format**: VTT (WebVTT)
- **Total Duration**: 50:00
- **Main Sections**: 6

---

## Section 1: Introduction and Overview (3:00)

**Duration**: 00:00:00 - 00:03:00

### Key Points
- Welcome to Tuesday afternoon session on AI-Assisted Software Development
- Overview of topics: custom agents, instruction files, CQRS architecture, dependency management, GitHub CLI
- Course structure and learning objectives

---

## Section 2: Introduction to Custom Agents (4:15)

**Duration**: 00:03:00 - 00:07:15

### Key Points
- Custom agents are specialized AI assistants for specific workflows
- Unlike general-purpose Copilot, agents have focused expertise
- Examples: security-focused agents, documentation agents
- Agents maintain context and follow specific configuration guidelines

---

## Section 3: Creating Agent Configuration Files (9:45)

**Duration**: 00:07:15 - 00:16:30

### Key Points
- Structure of agent.md configuration files
- Location: `.github/agents/` (repository) or `agents/` (organization)
- YAML front matter contains metadata: name, description, tools
- Markdown body defines behavior, expertise, and response patterns
- Example: security analyzer agent for vulnerability detection

---

## Section 4: Instruction Files and Repository Guidelines (8:00)

**Duration**: 00:16:30 - 00:22:00

### Key Points
- Instruction files define rules for ALL AI assistants
- Located in `.github/instructions/`
- Cover coding standards, architecture patterns, quality requirements
- Examples: vertical slice architecture, dependency management policy
- Instruction files are canonical - single source of truth

---

## Section 5: CQRS Architecture with Copilot (9:00)

**Duration**: 00:22:00 - 00:31:00

### Key Points
- CQRS: Command Query Responsibility Segregation pattern
- Separates write operations (commands) from read operations (queries)
- Commands focus on business logic and validation
- Queries optimized for fast retrieval with different data models
- Copilot instruction files ensure consistent CQRS patterns

---

## Section 6: Dependency Management and GitHub CLI (14:30)

**Duration**: 00:31:00 - 00:43:30

### Subsections

#### 6.1: Dependency Management Best Practices (7:00)
**Duration**: 00:31:00 - 00:38:00

- Dependency management critical for security and maintainability
- Policy should define approval processes, security scanning, update strategies
- Instruction files guide dependency selection and vetting
- Check vulnerabilities, license compatibility, maintenance status

#### 6.2: GitHub CLI Integration (6:30)
**Duration**: 00:38:00 - 00:43:30

- GitHub CLI is powerful tool for Copilot-assisted workflows
- Create agents/instructions for common gh commands
- Automate issues, pull requests, workflow management
- Integrate repository tasks into development workflow

---

## Section 7: Conclusion and Q&A (6:30)

**Duration**: 00:43:30 - 00:50:00

### Key Points
- Recap: custom agents, instruction files, CQRS, dependency management, GitHub CLI
- Key takeaway: AI-assisted development works best with clear, structured guidance
- Q&A session for clarification
- Reference repository for examples and documentation

---
