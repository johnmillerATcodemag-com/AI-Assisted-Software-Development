00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Welcome everyone to AI-Assisted Software Development with GitHub Copilot.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Today we'll cover the fundamentals of using AI in your development workflow.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Let's start with an overview of what we'll be learning today.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer that helps you write code faster.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It uses advanced machine learning models to suggest code completions.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
We'll explore how to use custom agents and promptfiles effectively.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Custom agents allow you to create specialized AI assistants for specific tasks.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Promptfiles are reusable task definitions that can be invoked in Copilot.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Let's dive into creating our first custom agent together.
