00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Welcome everyone to AI-Assisted Software Development with GitHub Copilot.

00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:12.000
Today we'll explore how AI can enhance your development workflow
and increase productivity.

00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:18.000
Let's start with the basics. GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer
that helps you write code faster.

00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:25.000
It's powered by OpenAI's Codex model and trained on billions of lines
of public code.

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:32.000
The first topic we'll cover today is setting up your development environment
for AI-assisted coding.

00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:40.000
You'll need Visual Studio Code or a JetBrains IDE, and a GitHub Copilot
subscription.

00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:48.000
Let me show you how to install the Copilot extension and configure it
for optimal performance.

00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:55.000
[Demonstration: Installing GitHub Copilot extension in VS Code]

00:00:55.001 --> 00:01:02.000
Great! Now that we have Copilot installed, let's look at some basic features.

00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:10.000
One of the most powerful features is inline code suggestions.
As you type, Copilot suggests completions.

00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:18.000
You can accept suggestions with Tab, or see alternative suggestions
with Alt+] or Alt+[.

00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:25.000
Let's write a simple function together and see Copilot in action.

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:35.000
[Live coding demonstration: Creating a user authentication function]

00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:42.000
Notice how Copilot understood the context and suggested relevant code.

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:50.000
This brings us to our next major topic: understanding how context works
in GitHub Copilot.

00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:58.000
Copilot looks at your open files, recent edits, and comments to provide
contextually relevant suggestions.

00:01:58.001 --> 00:02:05.000
The more descriptive your comments and variable names, the better
suggestions you'll get.

00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:13.000
Let's talk about best practices for getting the most out of Copilot.

00:02:13.001 --> 00:02:20.000
First, write clear and descriptive comments. Copilot uses these to understand
your intent.

00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:28.000
Second, use meaningful variable and function names. This helps Copilot
understand your code structure.

00:02:28.001 --> 00:02:36.000
Third, break complex problems into smaller functions. Copilot works better
with focused, single-purpose functions.

00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:45.000
Now let's discuss some advanced features, including Copilot Chat.

00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:53.000
Copilot Chat allows you to have conversations about your code directly
in your IDE.

00:02:53.001 --> 00:03:01.000
You can ask it to explain code, suggest improvements, or even write tests.

00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:10.000
Let me demonstrate how to use Copilot Chat for code review and refactoring.

00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:18.000
[Demonstration: Using Copilot Chat to refactor legacy code]

00:03:18.001 --> 00:03:25.000
As you can see, Copilot Chat can significantly speed up code understanding
and maintenance.

00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:33.000
Let's take a 5-minute break here, and when we return, we'll cover
testing with Copilot.

00:03:38.001 --> 00:03:45.000
Welcome back! Let's dive into automated testing with GitHub Copilot.

00:03:45.001 --> 00:03:53.000
Writing tests is crucial, but it can be time-consuming. Copilot can help
generate test cases.

00:03:53.001 --> 00:04:01.000
Let's write tests for the authentication function we created earlier.

00:04:01.001 --> 00:04:10.000
[Live coding: Generating unit tests with Copilot]

00:04:10.001 --> 00:04:18.000
Notice how Copilot suggested both positive and negative test cases.

00:04:18.001 --> 00:04:26.000
This brings us to our final topic: security considerations when using
AI-assisted development.

00:04:26.001 --> 00:04:34.000
While Copilot is powerful, you should always review its suggestions
for security issues.

00:04:34.001 --> 00:04:42.000
Never blindly accept code that handles sensitive data like passwords
or authentication tokens.

00:04:42.001 --> 00:04:50.000
Always use established security libraries and patterns rather than
rolling your own.

00:04:50.001 --> 00:04:58.000
Let's look at some common security pitfalls and how to avoid them.

00:04:58.001 --> 00:05:06.000
[Discussion: SQL injection, XSS, and other security concerns]

00:05:06.001 --> 00:05:14.000
To wrap up, let's review what we've covered today.

00:05:14.001 --> 00:05:22.000
We learned about setting up GitHub Copilot, understanding context,
best practices, and security.

00:05:22.001 --> 00:05:30.000
For homework, I'd like you to try using Copilot on your own projects
and document your experience.

00:05:30.001 --> 00:05:38.000
Are there any questions before we conclude?

00:05:38.001 --> 00:05:45.000
[Q&A Session]

00:05:45.001 --> 00:05:50.000
Thank you all for attending! See you next session.
