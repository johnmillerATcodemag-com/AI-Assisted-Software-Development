00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120
Welcome everyone to today's session on
AI-Assisted Software Development with GitHub Copilot.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.240
Today we'll explore how to leverage
GitHub Copilot effectively in your daily workflow.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.360
We have three main sections to cover:
custom agents, promptfiles, and best practices.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.620
Section 1: Introduction to Custom Agents

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.740
Custom agents are specialized AI assistants
that extend GitHub Copilot's capabilities.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.860
They allow you to define specific behaviors,
tools, and instructions for different tasks.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.980
For example, you could create a security analyzer
that focuses only on finding vulnerabilities.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.100
Or a test specialist that generates
comprehensive test coverage.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.220
The key benefit is consistency
across your team's development process.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.420
Section 2: Creating Promptfiles

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.540
Promptfiles are reusable task definitions
that can be invoked with a simple command.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.660
They're stored in the .github/copilot/Promptfiles
directory in your repository.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.780
Each promptfile has a YAML front matter
with metadata and arguments.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.900
The body contains Markdown instructions
that tell Copilot what to do.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.020
You can parameterize promptfiles with arguments
to make them flexible and reusable.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.140
For instance, a test generation prompt
could accept a file path as input.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.320
Section 3: Best Practices and Tips

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.440
Always provide clear, specific instructions
in your agents and promptfiles.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.560
Use task-oriented language
instead of behavioral descriptions.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.680
Test your configurations thoroughly
before deploying to your team.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.800
Keep your instructions focused
on a single responsibility.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.920
Document your agents and promptfiles
so team members understand when to use them.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.040
Version control everything
and track changes over time.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.220
Conclusion and Q&A

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.340
We've covered the fundamentals of
custom agents and promptfiles today.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.460
Remember, these tools are most effective
when used consistently across your team.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.580
Start small with one or two agents,
then expand as you gain experience.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.700
